Config Changes:

= Disabled auto scaling: [FancyMenu], [Client]
= Changed "Force GUI Scale" to 0: [FancyMenu], [Client]
= Moved the buttons closer to the center to ensure that they can't move outside of the game window depending on scale/window size: [FancyMenu], [Client]
= Logo now always stays in the middle between the buttons and the top of the screen: [FancyMenu], [Client]
= Changed cave ligting to "Very Dark": [ComplementaryReimagined], [Client]
= Disabled biome titles: [Travelers Titles], [Client]
= Disabled darkness from Nether and End dimensions: [True Darkness], [Client]
= Changed so that the mod only affects block light: [True Darkness], [Client]
= Moved multiple configs to be handled by YOSBR so that they dont get overwritten with each update('Inventory Profiles Next', 'FPS Reducer'): [YOSBR], [Client]
