Fabric version: Fabric-0.12.12
Update summary: New terrain generation in 'The End' dimension as well as other quality of life improvements.
WARNING: If you are going to play on a world created on a prior update, then make sure to delete the 'DIM1' folder from the world beforehand to avoid glitchy terrain in The End. This is due to the new world generation added by Nullscape.
