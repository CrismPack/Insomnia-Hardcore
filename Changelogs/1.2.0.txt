v1.2.0 - Major Update

Fabric version: Fabric-0.14.5
Update summary: Create mod, custom respawning command, phantoms nerf, many new structures and more!


Detailed update description: 
~ The 'Create' mod has launched on Fabric! Never heard of it? Then check out this video: https://youtu.be/jDIuWv7ROi8
~ Created a new custom 'Insomnia Respawn Datapack' that allows for server admins to easily respawn all players (including offline players). To respawn all dead players, use the following command on your server: "/function insomniarespawn:respawn".
~ Phantoms now don't spawn due to lack of sleep, but will instead spawn if you wander around too long in The End.
~ Many new structures has been added by the "Towns & Towers" datapack. It is an amazing datapack that we are overjoyed to be allowed to include, so please go and show the creator some love!
